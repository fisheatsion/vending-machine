 1. Vending Machine Program
Build a program that:
Displays a list of snacks and drinks with item numbers and prices.
Asks the user to choose items by number in a loop.
Keeps track of selected items and their prices.
Ends when the user types “done”.
Finally prints a receipt showing:
List of selected items with prices
Total cost
Skills practiced: loops, input(), conditionals, lists/dictionaries, sum(), print formatting
2. Simple Grocery Cart Checkout
Write a program that:
Has a predefined dictionary of groceries with prices.
Lets the user “add” items by typing their names.
For each valid item, asks for the quantity.
Keeps adding to the cart until the user types "checkout".
Displays a final bill: each item, quantity, subtotal, and total.
Skills practiced: dictionaries, loops, input(), math operations, formatting, error handling
3. To-Do List App (Text-Based)
Build a to-do list manager that:
Allows users to add tasks with priorities (e.g., "Buy milk - high").
Lets them view the current list, delete tasks by number, and mark tasks as complete.
Keeps looping until the user types “exit”.
Shows a summary at the end: number of completed tasks vs pending.
Skills practiced: lists, string parsing, loops, input, CRUD basics
4. Movie Ticket Booking Simulation
Simulate a movie theater booking system that:
Shows a list of available movie titles, showtimes, and seat prices.
Asks the user to choose a movie and number of tickets.
Confirms total price and asks if they want to book another movie.
Ends when they say “no” and displays total bookings and cost.
Skills practiced: loops, input, conditionals, calculations, nested dictionaries
5. Quiz Game
Create a basic quiz game that:
Contains a list of 5–10 questions stored in a dictionary (or list of dicts).
Asks the user each question and records their answers.
At the end, displays:
The user’s score (e.g., 7/10)
Correct answers for any questions they got wrong
Skills practiced: loops, dictionaries, input, comparison, counters, print formatting
print("checking pull request")
